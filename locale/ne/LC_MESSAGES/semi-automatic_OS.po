"The Semi-Automatic OS is a lightweight virtual machine for the land cover "
"classification of remote sensing images. It includes the Semi-Automatic "
"Classification Plugin for QGIS 2.2, already configured along with all the "
"required dependencies (SAGA GIS, GDAL, Numpy, SciPy and Matplotlib)."

"The Semi-Automatic OS is based on `Ubuntu <http://www.ubuntu.com/>`_ 13.10 "
"32-bit, and it is designed to require very little hardware resources. It "
"uses `LXDE <http://lxde.org/>`_ and `Openbox <http://openbox.org/>`_ as main"
" desktop environment. This virtual machine can be useful for testing the "
"Semi-Automatic Classification Plugin, or when the installation of the "
"required programs in the host system is problematic. |br| At the moment, the"
" Semi-Automatic OS is available as a virtual machine. The latest version is "
"downloadable here (about 500 MB). It is a .vmdk file (about 2.3 GB when "
"extracted) that can be run in the open source VirtualBox, or any other "
"virtualization program. The desktop includes a sample Landsat 8 dataset "
"available from the U.S. Geological Survey. |br| The following is a guide for"
" the installation of the Semi-Automatic OS in the open source program of "
"virtualization `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_."
