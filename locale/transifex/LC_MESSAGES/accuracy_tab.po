"Several statistics are calculated such as overall accuracy, user's "
"accuracy, producer's accuracy, and Kappa hat. In particular, these "
"statistics are calculated according to the area based error matrix where "
"each element represents the estimated area proportion of each class. This"
" allows for estimating the unbiased user's accuracy and producer's "
"accuracy, the unbiased area of classes according to reference data, and "
"the standard error of area estimates."

"The output is an ``error raster`` that is a ``.tif`` file showing the "
"errors in the map, where pixel values represent the categories of "
"comparison (i.e. combinations identified by the ``ErrorMatrixCode`` in "
"the error matrix) between the classification and reference. Also, a text "
"file containing the error matrix (i.e. a ``.csv`` file separated by tab) "
"is created with the same name defined for the ``.tif`` file."

"This tool supports ``virtual raster output``; if the output file name "
"ends with ``.vrt`` then the output is created as virtual raster composed "
"of as many ``.tif`` files as the number of CPU threads defined in "
":ref:`system_processing`; for large rasters this can speed up the "
"process."
