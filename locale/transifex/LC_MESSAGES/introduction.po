"Developed by Luca Congedo (ing.congedoluca@gmail.com), the **Semi-"
"Automatic Classification Plugin** (:guilabel:`SCP`) is a free open source"
" plugin for `QGIS <http://www.qgis.org>`_ that allows for the semi-"
"automatic classification (also known as supervised classification) of "
"remote sensing images. It provides several tools for the download of free"
" images, the preprocessing, the postprocessing, and the raster "
"calculation."

#: ../../introduction.rst:22
msgid ""
"The **overall objective** of :guilabel:`SCP` is to provide a set of "
"intertwined tools for raster processing in order to make an automatic "
"workflow and ease the land cover classification, which could be performed"
" also by people whose main field is not remote sensing."

":guilabel:`SCP` exploits the parallel processing of the tools provided by"
" `Remotior Sensus <https://remotior-sensus.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_, a"
" Python package that allows for the processing of remote sensing images "
"and GIS data."

"This **user manual** provides information about the :ref:`installation` "
"of SPC and the :ref:`interface`, with detailed information about all the "
"functions. In addition, the :ref:`remote_sensing` illustrates the basic "
"concepts and definitions which are required for using the "
":guilabel:`SCP`."

"The first version of the :guilabel:`SCP` was developed by Luca Congedo in"
" 2012 for the \"ACC Dar Project\" in order to create a tool for the "
"classification of land cover in an affordable and automatic fashion; "
"following versions of :guilabel:`SCP` were developed as personal "
"commitment to the remote sensing field and open source philosophy. "
":guilabel:`SCP` version 6 was developed in the frame of Luca Congedo's "
"PhD in Landscape and Environment at Sapienza University of Rome. "
":guilabel:`SCP` version 7 and version 8 as personal commitment to the "
"remote sensing field and open source philosophy."
